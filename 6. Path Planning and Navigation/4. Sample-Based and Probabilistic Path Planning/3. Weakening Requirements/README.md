# Weakening Requirements
Combinatorial path planning algorithms are too inefficient to apply in high-dimensional environments, which means that some practical compromise is required to solve the problem! Instead of looking for a path planning algorithm that is both complete and optimal, what if the requirements of the algorithm were weakened?

Instead of aspiring to use an algorithm that is complete, the requirement can be weakened to use an algorithm that is probabilistically complete. A **probabilistically complete** algorithm is one whoâ€™s probability of finding a path, if one exists, increases to 1 as time goes to infinity.

Similarly, the requirement of an optimal path can be weakened to that of a feasible path. A **feasible path** is one that obeys all environmental and robot constraints such as obstacles and motion constraints. For high-dimensional problems with long computational times, it may take unacceptably long to find the optimal path, whereas a feasible path can be found with relative ease. Finding a feasible path proves that a path from start to goal exists, and if needed, the path can be optimized locally to improve performance.

Sample-based planning is probabilistically complete and looks for a feasible path instead of the optimal path.

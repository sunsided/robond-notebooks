    "# Bayes Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "The powerful Monte Carlo localization algorithm estimates the posterior distribution of a robot’s position and orientation based on sensory information. This process is known as a **recursive Bayes filter**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a Bayes filtering approach, roboticists can estimate the **state** of a **dynamical system** from sensor **measurements**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In mobile robot localization, it’s important to be acquainted with the following definitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dynamical system:** The mobile robot and its environment\n",
    "- **State:** The robot’s pose, including its position and orientation.\n",
    "- **Measurements:** Perception data(e.g. laser scanners) and odometry data(e.g. rotary encoders)\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of Bayes filtering is to estimate a probability density over the state space conditioned on the measurements. The probability density, or also known as posterior is called the belief and is denoted as:\n",

    "This robot is located inside of a 1D hallway which has three doors. The robot doesn't know where it is located in this hallway, but it has sensors onboard that can tell it, with some amount of precision, whether it is standing in front of a door, or in front of a wall. The robot also has the ability to move around - with some precision provided by its odometry data. Neither the sensors nor the movement is perfectly accurate, but the robot aims to locate itself in this hallway.\n",

    "# Multi-Dimensional Extended Kalman Filter\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you’ve seen the fundamentals behind the Extended Kalman Filter. The mechanics are not too different from the Kalman Filter, with the exception of needing to linearize a nonlinear motion or measurement function to be able to update the variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ve seen how this can be done for a state prediction or measurement function that is of one-dimension, but now it’s time to explore how to linearize functions with multiple dimensions. To do this, we will be using multi-dimensional Taylor series.\n",

    "## Linearization in Multiple Dimensions\n",

    "You may notice a new term, Df(a). This is the Jacobian matrix, and it holds the partial derivative terms for the multi-dimensional equation.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\large Df(a) = \\frac{\\delta f(a)}{\\delta x}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In it's expanded form, the Jacobian is a matrix of partial derivatives. It tells us how each of the components of f changes as we change each of the components of the state vector.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "Phew, that got complicated quickly! Here are the key take-aways about Extended Kalman Filters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Kalman Filter cannot be used when the measurement and/or state transition functions are nonlinear, since this would result in a non-Gaussian distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instead, we take a local linear approximation and use this approximation to update the covariance of the estimate. The linear approximation is made using the first terms of the Taylor Series, which includes the first derivative of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the multi-dimensional case, taking the first derivative isn't as easy as there are multiple state variables and multiple dimensions. Here we employ a Jacobian, which is a matrix of partial derivatives, containing the partial derivative of each dimension with respect to each state variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it's important to understand the underlying math to employ the Kalman Filter, don't feel the need to memorize these equations. Chances are, whatever software package or programming language you're working with will have libraries that allow you to apply the Kalman Filter, or at the very least perform linear algebra calculations (such as matrix multiplication and calculating the Jacobian)."

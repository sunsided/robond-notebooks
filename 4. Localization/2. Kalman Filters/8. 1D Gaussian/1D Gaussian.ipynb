    "At the basis of the Kalman Filter is the Gaussian distribution, sometimes referred to as a bell curve or normal distribution. Recall the rover example - after executing one motion, the rover’s location was represented by a Gaussian. It’s exact location was not certain, but the level of uncertainty was bounded. It was unlikely that the rover would be more than a few meters away from its target location, and it would be nearly impossible for it to show up at the 50 meter mark.\n",

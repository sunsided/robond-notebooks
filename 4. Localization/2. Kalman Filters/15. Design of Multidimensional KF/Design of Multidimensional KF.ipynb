    "\n",
    "The formula below is the state transition function that advances the state from time _t_ to time _t + 1_. It is just the relationship between the robot’s position, $x$, and velocity, $\\dot{x}$. Here, we will assume that the robot’s velocity is not changing.\n",

    "We can express the same relationship in matrix form, as seen below. On the left, is the posterior state (denoted with the prime symbol, ' ), and on the right are the state transition function and the prior state. This equation shows how the state changes over the time period, $\\Delta t$. Note that we are only working with the means here; the covariance matrix will appear later.\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\large x' = Fx\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, the equation should also account for process noise, as its own term in the equation. However, process noise is a Gaussian with a mean of 0, so the update equation for the mean need not include it.\n",

    "Now, what happens to the covariance? How does it change in this process?\n",
    "\n",
    "Sidenote: While it is common to use $\\Sigma$ to represent the covariance of a Gaussian distribution in mathematics, it is more common to use the letter $P$ to represent the state covariance in localization.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you multiply the state, $x$, by $F$, then the covariance will be affected by the square of $F$. In matrix form, this will look like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\large P' = FPF^T\n",
    "$$\n",
    " \n",
    "However, your intuition may suggest that it should be affected by more than just the state transition function. For instance, additional uncertainty may arise from the prediction itself. If so, you’re correct!\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the posterior covariance, the prior covariance is multiplied by the state transition function squared, and QQ added as an increase of uncertainty due to process noise. QQ can account for a robot slowing down unexpectedly, or being drawn off course by an external influence.\n",
